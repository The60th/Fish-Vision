## Welcome!


This is the start of "Fish Vision" a open source modification of team 8397's (Beta) computer vision code. 

Currently will have full support for vuMark and jewel detection in the same opMode, without out worrying about releasing the camera to use for normal computer vision programs. 

Coming soon will be support for crypto box vision and glyphs. 

Version 1.0 (built on 12/7/17)
